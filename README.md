# What is Generative AI(Gen AI)
* Generative AI referes to a class of AI systems that learns patterns from large amount of data and generate new content such as text, images, code, audio or video

**Ex-**
1. Text - ChatGPT, Gemini for emails
2. Image - Adobe Firefly, Nano Banana
3. Code - cursor AI, co-pilot, Antigravity
4. Audio - Elevenlabs, suno, soundraw
5. Video - HeyGen, OpenAI

### Applications of GenAI
<code>Marketing & Advertising</code> <br>
<code>Customer Serivce</code> <br>

<code>HealthCare</code> <br>
<code>Education & Training</code> <br>
<code>Media Entertainment</code> <br>
<code>Gaming</code> <br>
<code>Government Sector</code> <br>
<code>Product Design, R&D</code> <br>

### GenAI has 2 phases
* Learning Phase
* Creating Phase

## What is LLM?

### Types of LLM

### Base LMM


***
## Why Prompt Engineering?
* output generated by GenAI closely resembles that of humans.
* It is relevant, contextual, imaginative and linguistically accurate.
* One of the critical factors in generating such an output is prompt.

## What is Prompt?
* Any input you provide to a generative AI model to produce a desired ooutput.
* You can think of it as an instructions that you proivde the model.

### Anatomy of perfect of prompt
1) **Persona** - Role of the AI(Ex : Act as a senior backend Engineer)
2) **Context** - What's the background(EX : I am a 1st year student)
3) **Task** - What exactly do you want?
4) **Constraints** - What should it avoid?(Do not use technical words)
5) **Output Format** - How do you want the answer? (EX : Markdown table, JSON format).
