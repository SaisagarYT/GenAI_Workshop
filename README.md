# What is Generative AI(Gen AI)
* Generative AI referes to a class of AI systems that learns patterns from large amount of data and generate new content such as text, images, code, audio or video

**Ex-**
1. Text - ChatGPT, Gemini for emails
2. Image - Adobe Firefly, Nano Banana
3. Code - cursor AI, co-pilot, Antigravity
4. Audio - Elevenlabs, suno, soundraw
5. Video - HeyGen, OpenAI

***
### Applications of GenAI
<code>Marketing & Advertising</code> <br>
<code>Customer Serivce</code> <br>
<code>Software Development</code> <br>
<code>HealthCare</code> <br>
<code>Education & Training</code> <br>
<code>Media Entertainment</code> <br>
<code>Gaming</code> <br>
<code>Government Sector</code> <br>
<code>Product Design, R&D</code> <br>

### GenAI has 2 phases
* Learning Phase
* Creating Phase

## What is LLM?
* LLM stands for **Large Language Model**.
* It is a type of AI model trained on a huge amount of text data.
* It understands, generates, and responds to human language.
* It can perform tasks like answering questions, writing content, summarizing text, and generating code.

**Ex-**
* GPT (ChatGPT)
* Gemini
* Claude
* LLaMA

***

### Types of LLM
* **Base LLM**
* **Instruction-Tuned LLM**
* **Chat-Oriented LLM**
* **Domain-Specific LLM**

***

### Base LLM
* A Base LLM is trained only on large-scale text data.
* It learns language patterns, grammar, and facts.
* It does not follow instructions by default.
* It mainly predicts the next word based on probability.

**Ex-**
* GPT base model
* LLaMA base model
* PaLM base model

## Why Prompt Engineering?
* output generated by GenAI closely resembles that of humans.
* It is relevant, contextual, imaginative and linguistically accurate.
* One of the critical factors in g`enerating such an output is prompt.

## What is Prompt?
* Any input you provide to a generative AI model to produce a desired ooutput.
* You can think of it as an instructions that you proivde the model.

### Anatomy of perfect prompt
1) **Persona** - Role of the AI(Ex : Act as a senior backend Engineer)
2) **Context** - What's the background(EX : I am a 1st year student)
3) **Task** - What exactly do you want?
4) **Constraints** - What should it avoid?(Do not use technical words)
5) **Output Format** - How do you want the answer? (EX : Markdown table, JSON format).

## Chain of Thoughts
### Description
* Chain of Thought refers to the step-by-step reasoning process used by an AI to arrive at an answer.
* It helps the model think logically by breaking a problem into smaller steps.

### Key Points
* Improves reasoning and accuracy
* Breaks complex problems into simple steps
* Useful for math, logic, and problem-solving tasks
* Helps in structured and clear answers
* Often guided by prompts like “explain step by step”


## System Prompts & User Prompts

### What is a System Prompt?
* A system prompt defines the role, behavior, rules, and response style of the AI.
* It controls **how the AI should behave throughout the conversation**.
* It has the highest priority over all other prompts.

**Ex-**
* "You are a professional software trainer. Explain concepts in simple terms with examples."
* "You are an AI assistant that answers only in bullet points."

***

### What is a User Prompt?
* A user prompt is the input, question, or instruction given by the user.
* It tells the AI **what the user wants at that moment**.
* It follows the rules defined by the system prompt.

**Ex-**
* "Explain REST API in simple words."
* "Generate a MongoDB schema for an e-commerce app."

***

### Key Differences Between System Prompt & User Prompt

<code>System Prompt</code>  
* Set by developer or platform
* Defines AI personality and behavior
* High priority 
* Usually hidden from users

<code>User Prompt</code>  
* Written by the user  
* Requests a specific task or information  
* Lower priority  
* Changes every interaction

***

### Simple Example
* **System Prompt:**  
  "You are an expert Java developer."

* **User Prompt:**  
  "Explain JDBC with an example."

* **Result:**  
  AI explains JDBC like a Java expert.


## ShopMate - Phase1

### Todays Agenda
* Setup shopmate on your laptop.
* setup mongodb atlas.
* setup google ai studio account.
* generate an api key.
* integrate the key into the website.

### Task 1: AI Product Description Writer
* It's a feature for admin user
* **The Problem**: Writing descriptions for 100's of products of boring and tedious.
* **The Solution:** Use AI to generate product descriptions.
* **The Logic:** user enters
   * "Leather Bag" in Name field
   *
